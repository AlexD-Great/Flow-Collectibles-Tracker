## Quick Overview

### The Problem
Flow collectors are fragmented across 4-6 different tools with no unified way to track performance, P/L, or get actionable alerts.

### The Solution
A performance-first portfolio tracker that unifies holdings, P/L tracking, liquidity insights, and alerts in one clean dashboard.

### Key Features
1. **Unified Portfolio View**: All Flow NFTs (Top Shot, All Day, UFC Strike, Catalog) in one place
2. **Real-time P/L Tracking**: Cost basis calculations and performance metrics
3. **Actionable Alerts**: Undercuts, floor breaks, big sales, liquidity warnings
4. **Cross-Market Comps**: Compare prices across marketplaces
5. **Shareable Portfolio Cards**: Viral distribution mechanism

### Business Model
- **Freemium**: Free tier with basic features, Pro tier ($7-15/mo) with advanced features
- **Target**: 500 free users → 50 Pro subscribers (~$500/month) in 90 days

### Why Flow?
- Strong collectibles vertical (NBA Top Shot, NFL All Day, UFC Strike)
- Supports open, interoperable Flow NFT Catalog
- Complements Flowramp (on-ramp → engagement loop)
- Increases retention and marketplace liquidity

### Development Timeline
- **Month 1**: MVP (wallet connection, holdings, basic alerts)
- **Month 2**: P/L tracking, cross-market comps
- **Month 3**: Pro tier launch, shareable cards, community distribution
